!! Work in progress !!

# Usage

* ```report [ip]``` will create [ip].txt in report directory with possible exploits
* ```hack [ip] [port] [mem_address] [expoit_string]``` will try to gain access

If access is shell then tool will start the session
If access is file or computer then tool will print content of all files and their paths

You can extend those tools as needed

# How to prepare

### Prepare libs
From "hacker" store you got via email get metaxploit.so and scanlib
Or just download anything that is free and place
- *.exe in /usr/bin
- *.so in /lib
- rest in /bin

### Create directories

In your home directory, make 2 directories
- cache
- reports

They will contain files generated by my scripts.
When you run "report [ip]" you will get report in your home_dir/reports/[ip].txt where you get info
From report you can copy CMD into terminal and run that

Of course after you compile report.src and pwn.src

### Prepare scripts

In main dir, open .src files and fix import_code because it has to have absolute path without variables

```
import_code("/home/madman/src/tools/dump.src")
```

Replace "/home/madman/src/tools" to location where you placed files.
For example if you have user "john" and in your home directory you make folder "code"
Then import would look like this:

```
import_code("/home/john/src/code/dump.src")
```

### Report tool

You only need to build src files in main directory, tools directory src is imported
But make sure you have report.txt in your home directory as stated in report.src
If you perform remote scan, report will be placed there
